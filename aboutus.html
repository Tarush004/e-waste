 <h1>About us</h1>
<b><p style="font-size:20px;">What is e-waste in LPU?</p></b>
<p style="font-size:20px;">E-waste is the term given to discarded electrical and electronic technologies; it includes, but is not limited to:</p>
<p style="font-size:20px;">• Computers, laptops and tablets</p>
<p style="font-size:20px;">• Televisions</p>
<p style="font-size:20px;">• Mobile phones</p>
<p style="font-size:20px;">• Digital cameras</p>
<p style="font-size:20px;">• Printers and photocopiers</p>
<p style="font-size:20px;">• Fax machines</p>
<p style="font-size:20px;">• USBs.</p>
<p style="font-size:20px;">Such equipment may or may not be in working order. With technology constantly being upgraded, disposal of outdated electronic equipment is occurring frequently. E-waste has accumulated at such a rapid rate that it has become the fastest growing form of waste in Australia. A total of 106 000 tonnes of e-waste had been dumped into landfill across Australia by 2008. By 2028 this figure is expected to rise to 181 000 tonnes. Until recently, e-waste has not been disposed of in the most efficient and environmentally sound manner.</p>

<h1>Why is E-waste a problem in LPU?</h1>

<p style="font-size:20px;">1.LPU members are among the highest users of new technology, and e-waste from obsolete electronic goodsis one of the fastest growing types of waste.</p>
<p style="font-size:20px;">2.E-waste now makes up 5% of all municipal solid wasteworldwide, nearly the same amount as all plastic packaging, but it is more hazardous.E-waste has a negative impact on our environment and is putting pressure on limited landfill capacity inLPU and around the world.</p>
<p style="font-size:20px;">3.Electronic technology includes toxic and harmful materials that to date have not been disposed of efficientlyor safely. Treating e-waste correctly will help minimise pollution, protect our environment and reduce ourcarbon footprint.Many of the materials that make up electronic technology can be recycled for other uses. <br><br>
For example, 90% of the materials in a mobile phone handset can be recovered and reused. Sixty per cent to 90% of futuregreenhouse gas emissions can be avoided by using these recycled materials.</p>
<p style="font-size:20px;"> 4.Fact: Recycling 50 000 mobile phone handsets can remove the need to mine 110 tonnes of goldore, 213 tonnes of silver-bearing ore or 11 tonnes of copper sulphide ore.</p>

<h1>Expected Outcomes:</h1>
<p style="font-size:20px;">1.The said project is under Digital India campaign, and it will impact the overall growth of the country as it Conserves natural resources.</p>

<p style="font-size:20px;">2.Recycling recovers valuable materials from old electronics that can be used to make new products. As a result, we save energy, reduce pollution, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and save resources by extracting fewer raw materials from the earth.</p>

<p style="font-size:20px;">3.Recycling will create jobs for professional recyclers and refurbishers and creates new markets for the valuable components that are dismantled.</p>

<p style="font-size:20px;">4.The project will also take care of the responsibilities of the producers that they must inculcate the Principle of EPR and follow the mechanism for channelization of e-waste to registered dismantler or recyclers.</p>
<p style="font-size:20px;">5.The programme will make sure that the responsibilities of other stakeholders are also met for effective implementation of the e-waste management rules, 2016.</p>

<p style="font-size:20px;">6.The programme will also work upon the awareness on Reduction in the use of hazardous materials in the manufacture of electrical and electronic equipment and their compo</p>
